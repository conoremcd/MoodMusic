# MoodMusic
A music player web application designed to generate playlists based on user input and preference data for mood. While the project focused on design of the interface and development resulted in a basic prototype, more robust database and machine learning algorithms could be developed to improve the backend design. This project was developed in CMSC434 in collaboration with three other students, Michael Abercrombie, Lucrecio Alberto, and Jean Claude Pasay. The class focused on processes and practices that incorporated user centered and user experience design. Original repository at lalberto0309/MoodMusic.git.
